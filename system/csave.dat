&CAlnar: hi, Varchild (chat)&D
&CSorine: Yo. (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Hello (chat)&D
&CVarchild: How'd you learn about the game by chance? Reddit? (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Yea I saw the post thought I'd check it out (chat)&D
&CVarchild: awesome. (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Ouch (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Apparently I'm too weak to kill a crab (chat)&D
&CVarchild: careful. They pinch (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Hm I can't see in the dark to get back to where I was (chat)&D
&CVarchild: Lemme conjure something up really fast for you (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I found my stuff (chat)&D
&CSanibak: And have truesight now so shouldn't need a light anymore (chat)&D
&CSanibak: if your hp gets to -1 do you regen naturally or just die (chat)&D
&CVarchild: You get bugged... Why? Did you break something? (chat)&D
&CSanibak: No, the mob I was fighting beat me up (chat)&D
&CSanibak: ouch (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Can I get a heal please? (chat)&D
&CSanibak: thanks (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Apparently it still thinks I'm morted (chat)&D
&CSanibak: nevermind (chat)&D
&CVarchild: Don't forget to save every so often. (chat)&D
&CVarchild: and after you finish the Lair quest, let me know, and I'll assign you a house. (chat)&D
&CSanibak: what lair quest? you mean at lvl 20? (chat)&D
&CSanibak: ouch (chat)&D
&CSanibak: um so they keep aggro apparently (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Well, I seem to be dying and losing xp faster than I can gain it. Gonna head out, but interesting take on playable dragons (chat)&D
&CSanibak: hello (chat)&D
&CCorrene: hi (chat)&D
&CSanibak: how's it going (chat)&D
&CCorrene: you ever plaid before? (chat)&D
&CCorrene: you ever plaid before? (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I played last night other than that no (chat)&D
&CCorrene: ah (chat)&D
&CCorrene: I used to have 15 chars lol (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Oh so you probably know what's going on a lot better than I do  (chat)&D
&CCorrene: yes (chat)&D
&CCorrene: all though I would like the sounds to exist again. and a little rusty (chat)&D
&CSanibak: You know where I should be leveling? (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Mobs in the areas at my range are too tough (chat)&D
&CCorrene: where are you going? (chat)&D
&CCorrene: I found my old soudsn. Time to see if they work! (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I used the portal stone to go to durdun and south harbor (chat)&D
&CSanibak: the crabs all gang up on me (chat)&D
&CCorrene: test (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I take a lot of damage as a dragon. Not sure if there's better gear for me to be using (chat)&D
&CCorrene: not at lower levels I think.  (chat)&D
&CSanibak: And I only get 4 pracs per level (chat)&D
&CTchen: How does wisdom play in determining pracs? (chat)&D
&CTchen: Is it static? or random? (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Dunno I have 18 wis (chat)&D
&CTchen: Same (chat)&D
&CCorrene: ah I think msp is broken. everything plays the same sound (chat)&D
&CTchen: I seem to have no skills that have to do with my current class. Do I need to find a guild trainer in order to do so, or do I just start off with very basic skills right now? (chat)&D
&CSanibak: If you type slist it shows a list of what you'll learn. There should be a trainer in the area. You can try whereis teacher or whereis trainer (chat)&D
&CCorrene: I think finding a guild trainer isn't a bad idea (chat)&D
&CSanibak: prac shows what you can actually practice (chat)&D
&CTchen: Thank! (chat)&D
&CTchen: You. (chat)&D
&CCorrene: this char just got deleted. Everyone make sure you save lol (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Hm ya you probably have to get to a minimum level, and the staff that was on last night kept telling me to save (chat)&D
&CLinnia: do you know how to get to quarry? (chat)&D
&CSanibak: no (chat)&D
&CHrathon: Any idea where I can find this wererat? (chat)&D
&CCorrene: whereis (chat)&D
&CHrathon: I'm dumb. Just was typing 'whereis were' not the whole thing (chat)&D
&CHrathon: Once I complete the basic chores and stuff, do I just go exploring? Am I done, or are there other quest givers around the city here? (chat)&D
&CLinnia: there is one other i think. where are you at (chat)&D
&CHrathon: Forbidden city (chat)&D
&CCorrene: oh no there isn't they. Just explore (chat)&D
&CCorrene: then (chat)&D
&CHrathon: Okay thanks :) (chat)&D
&CHrathon: How do I know if an item is type treasure? (chat)&D
&CSanibak: eventually you get the lore skill (chat)&D
&CSanibak: hi (chat)&D
&CVarchild: Heh. I need to edit the homepage in the help files. >.< (chat)&D
&CSanibak: player accounts are also case sensitive. like if I try to login with Sanibak instead of sanibak it says there's no such player (chat)&D
&CVarchild: That's a strange bug with the server and some mud clients. You have to enter your name twice apparently. (chat)&D
&CVarchild: That's a strange bug with the server and some mud clients. You have to enter your name twice apparently. (chat)&D
&CVarchild: I have to do that when I log in with Mudlet or Cmud, but it's just fine with Gmud32 (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Hm well I am using cmud and it didn't work for me no matter how many times I entered it until I put it all lower case (chat)&D
&CVarchild: I'll be back. (ooc)&D
&CThanila: thanks (chat)&D
&CSorine: Hey Gold... Think you could show me where you got the armor from later? (chat)&D
&CSanibak: me? the dragon area (chat)&D
&CSorine: Yes you. WHERE in the dragon area.  (chat)&D
&CSanibak: down fighting the fire ants (chat)&D
&PVarchild: Turning all channels off to get work done.  Please do not disturb with beep command unless emergency. (sooc)&D
&CVarchild: Turning all channels off to get work done.  Please do not disturb with beep command unless emergency. (ooc)&D
&CSorine: this (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: I think I am having an issue. My charictors keeps getting jdeleted even though I save. (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Do you ever get your characters past level 1? And have you tried typing in the char name in lower and upper case when you login? I had to do lower case (chat)&D
&CLinnia: uh oh (chat)&D
&CLinnia: let me check (chat)&D
&CLinnia: I did lower case (chat)&D
&CLinnia: let me try first letter caps and see if i messed up (chat)&D
&CSanibak: If you don't level up high enough it's possible it doesn't save (chat)&D
&CLinnia: no, first letter capitalized didn't matter. I also did create right before the crash (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Some MUDs you have to get to level 3 to save (chat)&D
&CLinnia: I don't think my level 7 dragon saved, but let me see. I needed to learn the cities anyway, i was rusty (chat)&D
&CSanibak: What was the character's name? (chat)&D
&CCorrene: does anyone know if the msp sounds work? (chat)&D
&CCorrene: I have an old sp (chat)&D
&CSanibak: have you been typing save? (chat)&D
&CCorrene: I have been yea, and I did before the crash, and i came back to no chars (chat)&D
&CSanibak: dunno (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Ask Varchild or beep him. He's doing coding stuff, but I'd say chars getting erased is worth poking him about (chat)&D
&CCorrene: can I get a bigger INVENTORY somehow? (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I do not believe so. Store stuff in bags (chat)&D
&CVarchild: Back. (chat)&D
&CLinnia: hi (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Correne was saying her characters are getting deleted. I told her to try upper and lowercase (chat)&D
&CLinnia: are you the one that can make sure i don't get deleted this time? (chat)&D
&CCorrene: this one too (chat)&D
&CVarchild: Go ahead and log out and back in again with one of them. (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Ohh is it because you didn't have your names approved by an imm (chat)&D
&CVarchild: HAHAHA! One moemnt (chat)&D
&CVarchild: HAHAHA! One moment. (chat)&D
&CCorrene: l (chat)&D
&CVarchild: sarcastically you can give me a lapdance as a thanks. (chat)&D
&CLinnia: i didn't know you had to do taht now (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I just remembered since mine was approved when I made my char (chat)&D
&CVarchild: Alrighty. I've approved both. go ahead and log out and in as ONE of them (chat)&D
&CLinnia: lmfao nope (chat)&D
&CVarchild: O RLY? Lemme dig into the files. (chat)&D
&CLinnia: I just need to not log this one off, so I have a link to you guys lol (chat)&D
&CLinnia: I wonder if you have a save after approval (chat)&D
&CVarchild: That's strange... (chat)&D
&CSanibak: ya I tried Correne and correne and it said no player (chat)&D
&CLinnia: that wouldn't make sense that it doesn't do that for you (chat)&D
&CVarchild: No your file is there but it says is can't open it. (chat)&D
&CSanibak: You didn't type save before logging out? (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Ah ha (chat)&D
&CLinnia: my file is there, but we can't access it, that's really wierd (chat)&D
&CLinnia: my file is there, but we can't access it, that's really wierd (chat)&D
&CLinnia: oops (chat)&D
&CVarchild: Try to make another (chat)&D
&CVarchild: I'm watching logs. (chat)&D
&CVarchild: I see the character file for Linnia (chat)&D
&CVarchild: The MUD is SUPPOSED to make directories in the player folder as each character is made, using the first letter of that character's name. (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: Apparently is wasn't. so I just copied over the correct folder structure and saved the data. (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: ah (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: gonna start the daily backup... (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: things might get slow for a moment or two... (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: when your dragon gets to level 20, you can do the lair quest. (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: and I'm doing something on the server that'll prevent this from happening in the future too. (ooc)&D
&CSanibak: anyone know where some higher level areas are (chat)&D
&CVarchild: you have to start exploring around. (chat)&D
&CSanibak: ah ok is there a world map somewhere (chat)&D
&CVarchild: -ish... The wilds are their own map... (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Hmm why is my char perma slowed with duration -2 seconds (chat)&D
&CVarchild: that help? (chat)&D
&CSanibak: still slowed (chat)&D
&CSanibak: holy breath is supposed to remove afflictions occasionally according to the message and it stays despite that too (chat)&D
&CVarchild: still? (chat)&D
&CSanibak: yup (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I think it's something the orcs are doing with an improper duration (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Or goblins. something in this area it didn't happen till I came here (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I tried removing all my gear to see if it was an affect on the gear and answer is no (chat)&D
&CVarchild: that's... weird... (chat)&D
&CVarchild: backup's done. (chat)&D
&CSanibak: hm xp is coming so slowly now (chat)&D
&CVarchild: happy hour stop? (chat)&D
&CVarchild: Nope (chat)&D
&CVarchild: Yo Sanibak. Log really quick, I'm gonna reboot the MUD so it clears up that silly log error that's happening. (chat)&D
&CSanibak: ah ok (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I'm the duke? lol (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I'll be a kind and gentle ruler (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I have slow on me still :( (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Ya the orc cooks are doing it I think (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Hmm ran out of mv (chat)&D
&CVarchild: Heh... You did it... (ooc)&D
&CSanibak: ya apparently (chat)&D
&CSanibak: So I'm the Duke apparently, but the guard wants me to pay to enter (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Oh I need a rune to activate the portal stone now  (chat)&D
&CSorine: that's why you gotta explore the wilds now. (chat)&D
&CSanibak: yea or buy a rune (chat)&D
&CCamlorn: Can I see exp gains? (chat)&D
&CVarchild: Use 'score' or 'stat' (chat)&D
&CCamlorn: no I mean as I gain it. (chat)&D
&CCamlorn: Ah, gag. (chat)&D
&CCamlorn: there we go. (chat)&D
&CSanibak: When I go back south it says Not Assigned. How do I get to my lair? (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Hm my lair is connected to dakar instead of forbidden city (chat)&D
&CVarchild: Lemme poke at something. (chat)&D
&CVarchild: Lemme poke at something. (chat)&D
&CVarchild: I'll have to look into that. (chat)&D
&CVarchild: Ohbugger (chat)&D
&CVarchild: I see what happened... Hold on. (chat)&D
&CVarchild: Alrighty Sanibak, warp back to your lair and pick everything up. (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Ok (chat)&D
&CVarchild: and I'll fix it, just gimme a little bit (chat)&D
&CSanibak: All right (chat)&D
&CVarchild: lemme know when you've gotten all your stuff. (chat)&D
&CCamlorn: Do we have shops that sell identify? (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I got it all (chat)&D
&CSanibak: So even citizens have to pay to get back into the city including the Duke?  (chat)&D
&CVarchild: not now. It puts you in the right area. (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Hmm when I went up I was outside (chat)&D
&CSanibak: When I go north it puts me in the cavern with the quartz runners and stuff  (chat)&D
&CSanibak: and if I go up it puts me outside the area and if I explore and navigate through the cave then I need to pay to get inside (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Oh I just have to go a few north from the quartz runner and go up. never mind (chat)&D
&CVarchild: I'm punching out for the night... (chat)&D
&CSanibak: night (chat)&D
&CVarchild: we have a website now: reddit.com/r/6dragonsreborn (chat)&D
&CSanibak: any tips on where I might look for a level 20 area (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Cause I don't see any way to see the level range of an area (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Oh I guess just type area and where (chat)&D
&CSanibak: so the citadel, dragons den, fox den, narcista vessel voyage, newunderdark,  (chat)&D
&CSanibak: sigh (chat)&D
&CSanibak: ran out of mv and drowned (chat)&D
&CSanibak: hi (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Quests don't give that much xp compared to grinding mobs. Do the intro quests to familiarize yourself with the game then go to the portalstone and explore the areas in your level range  (chat)&D
&CSanibak: they generally have quests (chat)&D
&CSanibak: one thing to keep in mind is after level 20 you can't use the trainer in your starting town. you have to go find the teachers out in the game that teach the stuff you want to learn, which is kinda annoying (chat)&D
&CSanibak: idk I only started playing the other day and only leveled up a dragon (chat)&D
&CZael: shame that the 'trash' command to get rid of unwanted items doesn't seem to be working... easy to fill up your inv if you loot everything (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Drop it on the ground and it works (chat)&D
&CZael: ah (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Don't fill up your inventory. Put stuff you want to hang onto in your backpack (chat)&D
&CSanibak: at level 20 I think you can get a home and leave your stuff there (chat)&D
&CZael: that's for sure what i'm trying to do, but... the thigns i fought dropped... a loooot of items so i filled up fast (chat)&D
&CSanibak: You don't have to autoloot everything (chat)&D
&CZael: i do it to make sure i get the money off the corpses (chat)&D
&CSanibak: That is what automoney is for (chat)&D
&CSanibak: If you get the identify spell or lore skill or something similar, yes (chat)&D
&CSanibak: maybe magic shop has id scrolls (chat)&D
&CZael: ah (chat)&D
&CZael: one of the newbie quests gave me an item that sounds like it might be a weapon.... but all i do is hold it, so that's why i was wondering about that (chat)&D
&CSanibak: the claw? (chat)&D
&CZael: yeah (chat)&D
&CSanibak: It isn't a weapon. It's treasure (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Items that are colored gold are treasure items. As a dragon having them in your inventory or when you get a lair dropping them in your lair and resting there increases your regen (chat)&D
&CZael: ah, so just no easy way to see that overall (chat)&D
&CZael: aaaah (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Dragons get the lore skill.  (chat)&D
&CZael: well i already knwo one way the dragon tutorial could be improved.. lol (chat)&D
&CSanibak: If you have ansi on and can see the colors yellow items are treasure as far as I can tell (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Keep in mind you can sell gear at the pawn shop (chat)&D
&CZael: yeah, but only 1 it seems... dones't accept more than 1 of the same item (chat)&D
&CSanibak: as a dragon once you get hardened scales you take much less damage (chat)&D
&CSanibak: And when you get breathe you deal much more damage (chat)&D
&CSanibak: nice thing about divine breath for gold dragons it heals you (chat)&D
&CSanibak: well, has a random chance to heal you just like holy breath has a random chance to cast cure afflictions on you (chat)&D
&CZael: nice (chat)&D
&CZael: that moment when you finish a quest with 5 seconds remaining on its timer (chat)&D
&CAlnar: helloes (chat)&D
&CZael: hi (chat)&D
&CAlnar: glad to see other people on! (chat)&D
&CZael: yeah, saw this place mentioned on reddit and was like 'oo dragons' (chat)&D
&CAlnar: same, actually knew it from its classic six dragons version but never managed to play it properly before it disappeared (chat)&D
&CZael: i think i saw it floating around on various sites, but never actually joined before (chat)&D
&CAlnar: it's supposed to be quite an amazing mud (chat)&D
&CAlnar: grats! (chat)&D
&CZael: thanks (chat)&D
&CZael: grats (chat)&D
&CAlnar: ty! (chat)&D
&CZael: so i saw how you become a duke, which is just being the highest level player... but how do people become barons, captians, sheriffs, and knights? you know? (chat)&D
&CAlnar: I have absolutely no idea and I'm curious to know that too! I suppose it could have anything to do with gaining status from sieging or defending from sieges? (chat)&D
&CZael: maybe someday we'll find out XD (chat)&D
&CAlnar: hopefully! And since I'm level 8 and you 12, do you have any suggestions for leveling? (chat)&D
&CZael: i spent a lot of time in that ice cavern so... i guess try there? XD (chat)&D
&CAlnar: will do so! (chat)&D
&CAlnar: and is there a way to know if any piece of eq found has the treasure flag, for treasure regen bonuses? (chat)&D
&CZael: i've been told that if the object is colored yellow, it's treasure... but once you get the lore skill you'll be able to see the information on the items (chat)&D
&CAlnar: ah, lore it is then no colors for me (chat)&D
&CZael: yeah... not really blind friendly with the only other way being the colors (chat)&D
&CAlnar: ah well can't complain too much considering everything else is super friendly instead (chat)&D
&CSanibak: hello (chat)&D
&CAllandir: Hey, pardon me breaking this channel's IC restriction, I'm new here. I've been dumped in a city with no tutorial, and I can't get to the wilderness which is where I would expect to be able to fight things. There's neither an OOC nor a newbie channel (chat)&D
&CAllandir: that I can ask questions in, and I can't delete and remake to see if being stuck without a tutorial is just some quirk of the undocumented Felinus race because I'm stuck at level 1 and apparently need to be level 2 to remake (why?). The game tells m (chat)&D
&CAllandir: The game tells me to follow my journaled quests, but I have none. Any tips? (chat)&D
&CAllandir: also, that length restriction bites (chat)&D
&CLinnia: yeah, I am wondering at what level mobs appear in the wildernesss (chat)&D
&CLinnia: I didn't even know that race existed. what city are you in (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Mobs only spawn in the wilderness randomly as you move through it (chat)&D
&CSanibak: There might be objects in the inventory like look list for a list of things to do (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Generally in the wilderness map you are looking for @ signs to signal an area.  (chat)&D
&CWigther: hmm, where is the place for learn trade skill for the dragon? (chat)&D
&CAlnar: no idea but you can't learn tradeskills till level 30 for dragons according to the helpfile (chat)&D
&CWigther: ah thanks. (chat)&D
&CWigther: not sure is a buck or not?, a few of quest accepted by dragon have no show on the journal. so i can not track the quest. (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Not sure what quests you are referring to (chat)&D
&CSanibak: As far as I can tell so far the quests award insignificant xp anyway (chat)&D
&CWigther: i found two quests. one is the  citizenship, and the quest in the abyss. (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Citizenship works you have to do what it says (chat)&D
&CAlnar: same for abyss (chat)&D
&CWigther: it work!, but isn't show on the journal. (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Dragons take a lot of xp to level. For example I have 6.3M xp and I need 2M more for my next level (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Quests seem to give like 8k xp (chat)&D
&CAlnar: the rp must be amazing though (chat)&D
&CWigther: i think dragon is leveling quickly. i tried the vampire, and it leveling really slow if compare to draogn (chat)&D
&CAlnar: likely because it deals high amounts of damage that makes it easier to levelup at lower levels, doesn't mean it won't eventually slow down to a crawl (chat)&D
&CWigther: agree (chat)&D
&CWigther: anyways, i lost my quest track for the dragon citizen! (chat)&D
&CAlnar: it has no quest track, just go speak with the trainer whose name I always forget... (chat)&D
&CAlnar: the dragon trainer (chat)&D
&CWigther: i need to find the blink monk, but don't remember where! (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I haven't tried vampire (chat)&D
&CAlnar: likewise though I should, still for rp reasons (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I need to find dispel magic, feline grace, gust of wind, pluck, and trance (chat)&D
&CAlnar: and is there a way to know approximately where to find these skills or it's just prayer and exploration? (chat)&D
&CSanibak: The trainer in town will teach you up to level 20 then you have to explore (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I randomly found third attack (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Once you get hardened scales at level 15 as a dragon you barely take damage and breathe does a lot of damage (chat)&D
&CAlnar: def looking forward to getting level 15 (chat)&D
&CSanibak: make sure to practice your stuff you want to practice before level 20 cause afterwards he stops teaching you anything  (chat)&D
&CAlnar: aye! (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Like I didn't bother practicing lend health cause no one else was really playing and now I can't (chat)&D
&CAlnar: what about humanform? (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I learned that (chat)&D
&CAlnar: from the trainer? (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I think it's just when you hit level 21 he stops (chat)&D
&CSanibak: yes  (chat)&D
&CAlnar: ah! that's good (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Unless I am mistaken (chat)&D
&CWigther: so, where you leveling in each level range? (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I just used the portalstone up until level 20 going to level appropriate areas then explored (chat)&D
&CAlnar: grats! (chat)&D
&CSanibak: thanks (chat)&D
&CSanibak: In hindsight, once you get hardened scales you should fight mobs as tough as you can handle because you get more xp (chat)&D
&CAlnar: some more suffering in the ice caves and I'll get there I hope (chat)&D
&CAlnar: unless there's a better area from 11 to 15 (chat)&D
&CWigther: heh, am stay in the gnome tower. (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I'd suggest saving regularly. I haven't seen any crashes today, but it crashed yesterday (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Breech lets you move to mobs, but seems like almost everything I try to breech to is shielded and drains all my mv. sucks (chat)&D
&CAlnar: an expmachine! (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Even after level 20 if you are a citizen you can use cityrecall FYI (chat)&D
&CAlnar: and if you're a baron? Also I wonder how did I become one and, mind you, I'm not complaining at all (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I think it might just be whoever was highest level. idk (chat)&D
&CAlnar: ah well, baron is nice (chat)&D
&CWigther: ok gtg guys! need some sleep. (chat)&D
&CAlnar: gnite (chat)&D
&CWigther: lol, just saw the ooc channel! (ooc)&D
&CWigther: anyways gtg (ooc)&D
&CSanibak: not sure how to get a tradeskill (chat)&D
&CAlnar: perhaps at the custom crafts room? the one east from the repairman (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Dunno the shopkeeper doesn't say anything (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Nevermind (chat)&D
&CAlnar: was it the place? (chat)&D
&CSanibak: No (chat)&D
&CSanibak: You get a quest from someone if you go to the right person in the city (chat)&D
&CAlnar: ah! good (chat)&D
&CAlnar: seriously? I die before getting the next level? sigh, sob... (chat)&D
&CSanibak: ouch (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I think the quest is bugged but we'll see (chat)&D
&CAlnar: lets see if something works.. (chat)&D
&CAlnar: ah, yes... (chat)&D
&CAlnar: I guess taxes have been lowered, too (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Ah ha I found an item to give me sanctuary (chat)&D
&CAlnar: great! (chat)&D
&CSanibak: So I think I know dragonic now... but dunno what I can do with it (chat)&D
&CAlnar: ah I have no idea, doesn't even seem to have a helpfile (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Apparently I can make dragon gear but I need metal to do it (chat)&D
&CAlnar: ah (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I don't think I can mine though (chat)&D
&CAlnar: doesn't seem so (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Ah once my trade level reaches 10 I can repair my own gear (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Oh you need to practice cone (in human form) to be able to craft stuff. I don't know where the cone teacher is and never practiced it at level 20 (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Grats (chat)&D
&CZael: i log in and suddenly i hold rank, lol (chat)&D
&CZael: man these things like walking in as i'm healing lol (chat)&D
&CTokihasha: does anyone know how to turn on the display of the experience gained after killing a mob? (chat)&D
&CZael: i'm always seeing xp gains, you seem to get them just by dealing damage (chat)&D
&CTokihasha: and you can't see the message after killing the mob, like you got so much experience? (chat)&D
&CZael: a total of XP gained throughout the fight? not that i've seen, just all those XP messages after landing attacks (chat)&D
&CTokihasha: maybe I can't see because of the screen reader mode enabled (chat)&D
&CZael: ah, maybe... could be disabled in screen reader mode to help prevent spam (chat)&D
&CTokihasha: config gag? (chat)&D
&WZael tells: Sanibak hopefully the admin gets on... i found something that's a little... sus... only mentioning it to since it affects you right now&D
&WSanibak tells: Zael What's that?&D
&CSanibak: last (chat)&D
&WZael tells: Sanibak apparently he's uploading the game to github since it's open source... but he's including pfiles as well, and yours is up there... it's an old pfile from 20 hours ago, but it includes your IP&D
&CSanibak: Hm not sure how to see chat history. tell last works (chat)&D
&WSanibak tells: Zael Yea, I noticed that&D
&WSanibak tells: Zael Not sure if he can exclude syncing player files from the github. Would be a good idea&D
&WZael tells: Sanibak it would be, otherwise that's a big security flaw&D
&WSanibak tells: Zael I was thinking of compiling the MUD and launching it locally just to see a list of teachers to practice my skills heh&D
&WZael tells: Sanibak lol&D
&WZael tells: Sanibak oh wow, even the log file is getting uploaded, so you can see people giving items&D
&WSanibak tells: Zael I'm not sure if he actually intends to update and fix things or if it was just to put an old MUD code up again&D
&WZael tells: Sanibak well, on the subreddit for this MUD he said he plans to, wants to put in new races, and put up something saying he's looking for a coder&D
&CLinnia: has anyone had mobs appear for them in the wilderness, because I haven't (chat)&D
&CZael: i haven't been in the wilderness, so unfortunately i have no idea (chat)&D
&WZael tells: Sanibak how'd you get the dragonic trade craft?&D
&WSanibak tells: Zael Get to level 30 and do a quest&D
&WZael tells: Sanibak ah, level 30... okay, thanks&D
&CVarchild: Yo (ooc)&D
&CZael: hi (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: I'll be doing some modifications here shortly which will require a reboot. Just be aware. (ooc)&D
&CZael: i have noticed something that can be considered... a bit of a security flaw, just a heads up (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: what's going on? (ooc)&D
&CZael: you were uploading pfiles to the github, which includes peoples ips (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: and if the MUD starts becoming slow. I'm also updating the OS on the hardware hosting the MUD. (ooc)&D
&CZael: just didn't want it to fly under the radar and potentially go unreported and abused (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: I appreciate that. (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: doing a recompile on the MUD right now... (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: OS updates finished. I'll have to restart the system after the compile is completed. (ooc)&D
&CZael: alright (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: Runs on Linux, so it shouldn't be down that long. (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: Alrighty. Gonna reboot the OS and then the mud. See you in 5 minutes. (ooc)&D
&CZael: what kind of changes are you putting in? (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: Updating the MSSP data (ooc)&D
&CZael: ah (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: I need to figure out how to update the website references in some of the command output too (ooc)&D
&CZael: like the ones in 'who'? (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: Yep. Exactly those. (ooc)&D
&CZael: that shouldn't be hard to do (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: this is true, it's just that the documentation is pretty spotty (ooc)&D
&CZael: i can already see how to fix the who in who, lol (ooc)&D
&CZael: the one in who* (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: Alrighty. Game is being rebooted for a quick update. (ooc)&D
&CTasivil: aprove me first! (ooc)&D
&CTasivil: woo! (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: Alrighty. game will be back up in like 2 min. (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: at what level do wilderness mobs appear. I haven't seen any (chat)&D
&PZary: Greetings everybody! (sooc)&D
&CVarchild: They should appear. (chat)&D
&CLinnia: they aren't (chat)&D
&CLinnia: only in ocean. (chat)&D
&CZael: i'm having them appear as i wander around... hmm (chat)&D
&CLinnia: you are level 17 (chat)&D
&CZael: i'll look into it and see if i can find anything (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: as soon as you can. It seems that beastmaster isn't much without a companion (ooc)&D
&CZary: it looks like they might start spawning in at level 6 (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: hmmm how can i get to that (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: ah I know (ooc)&D
&CZary: i believe there should be weak mobs in the starting town... that's how it is for dragons, at least (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: all i saw was rats so far, but I can look (ooc)&D
&CZary: lets hope i was right on that, lol (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: woo! (ooc)&D
&CZary: that a 'woo, that did it'? lol (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: how do I take control of the pet and level it again? (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: also, do you guys have plays to get the msp sounds working at some point. all they play right now is beeps? (ooc)&D
&CZary: it looks like you might be able to use hte 'order' command to get it to do stuff (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: I used to be able to walk around in their bodies and level them up that way (ooc)&D
&CZary: ah, i think that might be a skill for beastmaster... i've never played one... still learning things myself (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: ah. is there a way to see what skills you can get later. that might refresh me (ooc)&D
&CZary: slist (ooc)&D
&CZary: looks like the skill you might be looking for is beast meld, at level 9 (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: ah (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: need to get there then. (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: how do I check what level my pet is (ooc)&D
&CZary: try order name petreport... where you replace name, with the name of the pet (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: what is affection (ooc)&D
&CZary: looks like it can help gain some bonus xp? tbh i'm not sure (ooc)&D
&CTasivil: and l in bag (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: do you know of any equiptment pets can wear, or how else to increase dps (ooc)&D
&CZary: i'm unsure (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: hmm, as soon as I get that command. and maybe I get a char that crafts claws. need to get a blacksmith statrted. I have been having a ton of fun. my friends plaid this game back in the day. (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: think I figrued out what the problem is (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: What's that? (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: hahahahaha (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: what are you doing? o_O (ooc)&D
&CZary: that's not me (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: you walk into the same wilderness room, and you fight yourself haha (ooc)&D
&CZary: you... fight yourself? (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: your pet fights you (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: when your east melded, you are an enimy for your pet if you walk into the same room (ooc)&D
&CZary: that's odd (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: is theree a way that I can make a beast order part of my combo? (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: becuase right now I only have one attack skill (ooc)&D
&CZary: i'm unsure (ooc)&D
&CBarivon: hmmm do I want to stay awake to do that. all though if I idle out at this stage this one would be deleted right? is there any way to check approval statuses? (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: You have to be sure to SAVE your character (ooc)&D
&CBarivon: woo, now I can go to bed if I want. I saved once or twice already, but wasn't sure if that would keep me from timing out, when not aproved (ooc)&D
&PVarchild: So... I already have the feline race made. (sooc)&D
&PZary: nice (sooc)&D
&PVarchild: You have any ideas for more beast-themed races? (sooc)&D
&PZary: just standard races... but the more i delve into things, the more i'm not seeing a way to convert things into racial abilities... the game has everything set up to be heavily tied into classes... (sooc)&D
&PVarchild: Well, it's not EVERY skill that needs a racial check. Just claws, bite, smell, and wings (sooc)&D
&PZary: yeah that's what i'm saying... for pixie, flying isn't a skill like 'wings' is... they just naturally get to fly, bypassing all the things to do with skills... otherwise, all the information is set in the class files (sooc)&D
&PVarchild: Seriously? (sooc)&D
&PZary: yep (sooc)&D
&PVarchild: lemme see... (sooc)&D
&PZary: if you look in the 'classes' folder, you can see how even all the skills dragons share... are set there... the min level they get a skill at... and the max level it can be trained to (sooc)&D
&PZary: it's all handled in those files (sooc)&D
&PVarchild: *groans* (sooc)&D
&PVarchild: Then think you could write something up that ADDS those mentioned skills based on race then? (sooc)&D
&PZary: from the looks of it... doing so would require a complete rewrite of skills/classes... and that is way, way, beyond my skill set (sooc)&D
&PVarchild: buggerit. (sooc)&D
&PVarchild: I'll keep a look out for a coder then... (sooc)&D
&PVarchild: I'm punching out for a little bit. Will probably jump back on in a few. (sooc)&D
&CSanibak: hello (chat)&D
&CKraegar: Hi.  (chat)&D
&CWigther: hello! (chat)&D
&CKraegar: I used to play here ond on Dragons of Exhile. Long ago. (chat)&D
&CSanibak: never played here before. don't suppose you have a list of where teachers are located (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I have a bunch of skills/spells I can't find (chat)&D
&CKraegar: no clue. Sorry. (chat)&D
&CKraegar: congrats (chat)&D
&CWigther: thx (chat)&D
&CKraegar: Hi and welcome Galen. (chat)&D
&CVarchild: so the game crashed again? (ooc)&D
&CGalen: Greetings (chat)&D
&PZary: what are you trying to do? (sooc)&D
&PVarchild: I was just playing around. (sooc)&D
&PVarchild: gonna head to bed. (sooc)&D
&PZary: ah (sooc)&D
&CSanibak: ouch (chat)&D

&CAlnar: helloes (chat)&D
&CCorrene: hello (chat)&D
&CAlnar: ah, glad to see we're back on (chat)&D
&CVonLancelot: I'm sorry about that.  I logged the bug report for you. (chat)&D
&CAlnar: ah, thank you! (chat)&D
&CVonLancelot: time for dinner.  *wave* (chat)&D
&CAlnar: have a good dinner (chat)&D
&CVarchild: yo (chat)&D
&CAlnar: hi, Varchild:! And assuming you're the one that brought this place back up, thank you (chat)&D
&CVarchild: yes I did. I'm the head admin and this runs on one of my machines. :) (chat)&D
&CAlnar: appreciated, this place always had tons of potential! (chat)&D
&CVarchild: did you use to play 6Dragons Classic? (chat)&D
&CAlnar: shortly, yes (chat)&D
&CVarchild: I'm still trying to reach out to Vladaaar... (chat)&D
&CAlnar: read that on reddit, yep (chat)&D
&CAlnar: hey Varchild since you're here... As apparently the quest chapters havn't been described correctly in the Halcyon quest... What message did I need to refer to Kyfaek? (chat)&D
&CVarchild: No idea... >.< (chat)&D
&CAlnar: mh, I see... (chat)&D
&CVarchild: Having fun? (chat)&D
&CTasivil: yes (chat)&D
&CTasivil: I missed this (chat)&D
&CVarchild: I'm glad you're enjoying it. (chat)&D
&CTasivil: I am. :) Soon eoungh I will have my stock of characters back :) (chat)&D
&CVarchild: I'm trying to find Vladaar... (chat)&D
&CTasivil: for what? (chat)&D
&CVarchild: he was the Admin of 6dragons classic. (chat)&D
&CVarchild: you LOVE the crafting, don't you? (chat)&D
&CKraegar: Congrats (chat)&D
&CNeos: thanks. (chat)&D
&CWigther: do you want join our group for running exp? (chat)&D
&CKraegar: Congrats (chat)&D
&CRaino: thanks. (chat)&D
&CRaino: ouch (chat)&D
&CKraegar: oh well (chat)&D
&CKraegar: congrats again (chat)&D
&CRaino: ya thanks again (chat)&D
&CAlnar: morning (chat)&D
&CAlnar: hi, Kraegar (chat)&D
&CKraegar: Hi Alnar. (chat)&D
&CAlnar: considering the quantity of gold dragons compared to other colors I wonder if I did the wrong thing being silver, or the wisest of them all... (chat)&D
&CKraegar: I use to play as several different dragons years ago on Dragon's of Exile. (chat)&D
&CKraegar: I loved gold's magic casting. (chat)&D
&CKraegar: Trying it out here. (chat)&D
&CAlnar: and with that intelligence seems easier to master skills! (chat)&D
&CKraegar: Looks to be that way. (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Hmm I need to find some high level mobs to fight (chat)&D
&CSanibak: hi (chat)&D
&CAlnar: hi! (chat)&D
&CSanibak: So the feline grace spell is bugged. If you get it don't try to cast it will crash the mud (chat)&D
&CAlnar: no worries I've no magic to speak of (chat)&D
&CAlnar: only a nice amount of silvery, scales? at level 35 (chat)&D
&CAlnar: also, Sanibak, would you by chance have any area suggestions for exping apart from Szithlin? it's starting to be quite the, long millionaire trip from a level to the next (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Hm I don't even know what mobs are in there (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I just type area and go wherever the area suggestions are for your level. As a dragon once yuo have hardened scales you can go a bit above your level (chat)&D
&CAlnar: ah, Szithlin is drows... Nasty ones that use thaintin and with their shield take a while to diebut seem to pay almost half a million per kill (chat)&D
&CSanibak: idk what the ideal xp levels are. it's annoying trying to level in my range (chat)&D
&CSanibak: when mobs afflict you you become crazy quickly (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Seems like it's not worth using any dragon abilities to fight stuff besides breathe everything else does poor damage in comparison (chat)&D
&CWigther: agree. (chat)&D
&CAlnar: I still like using combo if it includes breath, it's little extra damage but damage nonetheless... (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Fair enough. I didn't even realize you could use breathe in a combo (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Huh I haven't seen that before. apparently my talons can poison now (chat)&D
&CSanibak: I hate how all these mobs have poison, thaitin, dispel magic, etc. (chat)&D
&CLinnia: what ones (chat)&D
&CSanibak: like every high level area I try to fight in (chat)&D
&CLinnia: do you have any crafted gear? (chat)&D
&CVarchild: who kept crashing the game? >:O (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: anyone awake? o_O (chat)&D
&CLinnia: hi (chat)&D
&CVarchild: She lives! (chat)&D
&CVarchild: I finally have the name for the canine race... so it'll be created here in a few hours. (ooc)&D
&CTasivil: fix the cat race too? you have no starting cith with those, the last time I tried to play (ooc)&D
&CTasivil: please :) (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: that's one the list. (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: er... ON the list (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: New race is almost done... Which means the game is going to have to go down for a recompile then I'll bring it back up. (ooc)&D
&CBarivon: when (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: Gotta do a few more tweaks... (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: did you fix cats too? (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: I'm trying to figure that out too... >.< (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: have to do another recompile, then run and adjust classes for it. (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: Reboot incoming! (ooc)&D
&CSanibak: hi (chat)&D
&CSanibak: Hmm so until I am level 60 I won't be able to cure thaitin iceshard and flare with cure affliction (chat)&D
&CRaino: hi hi (chat)&D
&CRaino: congrats. (chat)&D
&CCorrene: so none of the characters got saved. does this mean I need to start over, or did the files get corrupted with the tests (ooc)&D
&CCorrene: I just restarted this one so I could talk on here, and not on the redit until I can figure out what to do next (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: lemme look at the backend stuff (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: should be good now. (ooc)&D
&CCorrene: what happened? (ooc)&D
&CCorrene: anyone have any advice on how to keep an msp path set? (ooc)&D
&CAnya: is the recall command not working? When I type it nothing happens (ooc)&D
&CCorrene: you need to get past the tutorial quests (ooc)&D
&CAnya: OH thanks! It just worked haha (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: able to save just fine? (ooc)&D
&CMearra: looks like it (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: Gonna restart the game, clear some of these errors out. (ooc)&D
&CCorrene: now taking any chances this time haha (ooc)&D
&CCorrene: not (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: Looks like the character files saved. (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: Game will be right back up. (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: Uh-oh (ooc)&D
&CCray: hi (chat)&D
&CIsahn: Yo! (chat)&D
&CCray: what are you doing? (chat)&D
&CIsahn: Grinding. Trying to figure this out.  (chat)&D
&CIsahn: Oh.. cool. 40% of a level. Awesome.  (chat)&D
&CThelfusa: Hello I am new (chat)&D
&CThelfusa: Can I please have some help at Melanie's shop (chat)&D
&CIsahn: Hi. What's up? (chat)&D
&CThelfusa: I am a new blind player using VIPMUD (chat)&D
&CLinnia: welcome (chat)&D
&CThelfusa: I need to know what to buy at Melanie's shop (chat)&D
&CIsahn: I don't think anything really.  (chat)&D
&CIsahn: Oh is that the mystical one? With the potions?  (chat)&D
&CThelfusa: it says on my list to go to Melanie's shop (chat)&D
&CIsahn: Oh right. Yeah that's the quest one. I think you just talk to her and it updates the quest.  (chat)&D
&CThelfusa: How do I do that? (chat)&D
&CIsahn: There are specific things you have to say to the NPCs to trigger the quest dialog. I honestly forget what that one is.  (chat)&D
&CThelfusa: ok can I please talk to an administrator? (chat)&D
&CIsahn: I don't see one on right now.  (chat)&D
&CIsahn: That quest isn't super important. I think it gives you a single health potion and a mana potion. (chat)&D
&CThelfusa: well then how am I supposed to complete my task? (chat)&D
&CLinnia: you just walk into the room (chat)&D
&CThelfusa: I walked into the room (chat)&D
&CThelfusa: I feel totally useless right now (chat)&D
&CThelfusa: I feel dumb now (chat)&D
&CIsahn: Uh oh? What happened? What did I miss?  (chat)&D
&CThelfusa: I need to download sound files but can't get to the website (chat)&D
&CIsahn: Yeah I don't know how that works either. There is a website but it looks like its abandoned.  (chat)&D
&CIsahn: There is a subreddit that the admin keeps pretty good contact with.  (chat)&D
&CThelfusa: Your text is nonsense (chat)&D
&CIsahn: Well it reads perfectly in sentences to me.  (chat)&D
&CIsahn: Not sure what to tell you (chat)&D
&CThelfusa: I am connected to wifi (chat)&D
&CIsahn: Okay?  (chat)&D
&WThelfusa tells: Linnia I need help&D
&CThelfusa: Argh (chat)&D
&CThelfusa: I need help at Kalarn (chat)&D
&CIsahn: What's up?  (chat)&D
&CThelfusa: Can I please have some help (chat)&D
&CThelfusa: I need help with Tarane (chat)&D
&CLinnia: what are you trying to do (chat)&D
&CThelfusa: it says that I am rather wet underneath the ears so I can't do the first task for Tarane (chat)&D
&CLinnia: gain some levels (chat)&D
&CThelfusa: How do I gain levels? (chat)&D
&CThelfusa: How do I get stronger? (chat)&D
&CVarchild: New server hardware came in today. I just need to get it put together and what not. (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: cool what will it do (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: More RAM for the base system. the OS's should be compatible between upgrades. FYI: The mud runs on a Raspberry Pi. (ooc)&D
&CThelfusa: Hello (ooc)&D
&CThelfusa: Can I please talk to a staff member? (chat)&D
&CLinnia: ask on ooc (chat)&D
&CThelfusa: Can I please talk to a staff member? (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: What's going on? (ooc)&D
&CThelfusa: I can't seem to download the soundpack for 6 dragons reborne (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: You'll have to a little bit of digging. I'm like spread thin between a bunch of things at the moment. (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: Server is going to get a RAM bump... extensively... Double the RAM (ooc)&D
&CThelfusa: Can I please ask how to extract the sound file? (ooc)&D
&CThelfusa: I need help unzipping this soundfile (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: You'll want to use something called 7zip (ooc)&D
&CSanibak: Hello (ooc)&D
&CThelfusa: ok I have 7 zip but it isn't working (ooc)&D
&CSanibak: Are all the spells I bugged still broken? (ooc)&D
&CThelfusa: Hello my name is thelfusa (ooc)&D
&CSanibak: I did download the code and get it running on a linux virtual machine a week or two ago (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: There will be some 'fragmentation' of your characters from where they are when I shut the game down and bring it back up on the new hardware. (ooc)&D
&CSanibak: How so? Meaning don't bother leveling now? (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: Yes. I recommend chilling for the time being. (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: get some Role playing in (ooc)&D
&CSanibak: Ok see ya gonna go watch moon knight (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Do it! (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: No spoilers!! (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Alright. This crab quest is obviously bugged.  (chat)&D
&CVarchild: No spoilers!! (ooc)&D
&CVladero: congrats (chat)&D
&CVarchild: There, upgrades are all done. (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Yo (chat)&D
&CVladero: grats (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Woo! Thanks, Boss.  (ooc)&D

&CWigther: oh!, look like they adjusting something. may be adjust balance also (chat)&D

&CWigther: or not? (chat)&D
&CWigther: i think it in the game. (chat)&D
&CWigther: yeah, dragon city isn't big, but hy you didn't find the quest! (chat)&D
&CIsahn: I see that it mentions the dragon slayers. but they were in the dragon only zone that I could only reach through using the portal stone. Which is deactivated now. (chat)&D

&CIbrahim: Hi. And welcome back. (ooc)&D
&CThelfusa: I need a corpse retrieval from the undertaker but don' (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: For equipment/weapons, is crafting the way to go or there are pretty good options you find from exploring? (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: You want to become close friends with someone who can craft. (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Gotcha. (ooc)&D
&CThelfusa: I would craft something but don't know how to (ooc)&D
&CSorine: look (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: As an Angel, I should just be able to type in the fly command to be flying? (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: Yep (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: It doesn't seem to be working.  (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: I'm getting the "huh?" message. (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: Let me poke at that those files. (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Thanks. (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: How do I get rid of items I don't want? Like a junk command or anything? (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: trash <item> (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Thanks. (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: :( I missed a happy hour (ooc)&D
&CSorine: <sarcasm> Bribe the admin with lap dances? </sarcasm> (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Lol! (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: No comment. >_> (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: The primary ways to heal are potions, the healer, and skills/spells? (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: Yes. (ooc)&D
&CThelfusa: See you all on Friday (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: See ya. (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: When you enter a city or area from the wilderness, do the mobs chasing you lose interest? (ooc)&D
&CSorine: Generally yes. (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Okay, great. (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: Alrighty. Need to reboot the game. (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Okay. (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: This SHOULD restore wings to a few races. (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Nice! (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: So go ahead and come back in and test. (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: I think it's working. (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: What are good ways to earn money? Crafting and selling those items? (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: Yep yep (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Alrighty. (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: I'm off to bed. Good night! (ooc)&D
&CThelfusa: Hello all (chat)&D
&CThelfusa: Good morning it is Friday (ooc)&D
&CThelfusa: I'm back (chat)&D
&CIsahn: Anyone know how many crafting levels I'll need before I can actually make anything? (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Hi, folks. (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Yo! (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Is glory still a thing that can be used? (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: I'm new. I don't know a lot of things.  (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: No problem. Same here, lol. (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Back to work. See you guys later. (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Later, Boss (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Is 25 the maximun allowable stat? (ooc)&D
&CMearra: I think so (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Hello again. (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Hello! Welcome back! (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Thanks! (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Congrats! (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Thanks, Boss.  (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Do you find a lot of money in killing NPCs, Isahn? (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Yeah tons. But not much to spend it on.  (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Oh okay.  (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: And pretty decent equipment? I know you're a dragon so you don't need it as much but plenty of drops? (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: I want to upgrade my eq so just figuring out how it works outside of player made stuff. (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Yeah. There is a dragon-only zone at about level 10 you can go to and the mobs there drop almost a full set of gear eventually.  (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Oh wow. (ooc)&D
&CDyrk: how do i look up item stats? (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Then once you're about 15 or 20 or so the western mountain I believe is where I got a couple pieces of gear.  (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Oh, so when you say the dragon only zone.. it isn't just that dragons can enter? (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Dyrk, if you have the identify spell, that should help. (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Do you get the lore skill? I have the lore skill. That's what I use.  (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Or that. (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Also, the score, swap item, score again and check for differences was my go-to for a bit. haha (ooc)&D
&CDyrk: i just started... (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Lol! A classic method. (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: I'm not sure. I hadn't tried it with another character. I just know when you go to activate the portal stone is says dragon-only. Not sure if it really is or not.  (ooc)&D
&CDyrk: i dont have lore skill yet. im war/druid (ooc)&D
&CDyrk: does the skill list progress later as i level? (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Yes. You can check slist to see everything though. (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: slist warrior or slist druid (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: New skills are automatically added at 0 skill when you reach the required level. You'll need to find a teacher that teaches it when you're over level 20. (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: New skills are automatically added at 0 skill when you reach the required level. You'll need to find a teacher that teaches it when you're over level 20. (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Oops.  (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Oookay. Yardwork time. Woo! (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Lol! Have fun! (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Be back later. Have a good one. :D (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: I shall return. (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: See ya. (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: So.. that was my fault? Lol. (ooc)&D
&CVladero: Good evening everybody. (chat)&D
&CIbrahim: Hi Vladero. (ooc)&D
&CVladero: Congrats Ibrahim. (chat)&D
&CIbrahim: Thanks! (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Off to bed. Good night! (ooc)&D
&CVladero: goodnight (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Hi, folks. (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Yo (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: hi (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: What kind of things is the dragonic craft used for? (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Anyone else crash? Just me?  (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: It came up again. (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Woo! Nice work. :D (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: Cron jobs and linux bash scripts. >:3 Generally keeps the game up. There a few times where the games has locked up completely, but the host OS is stable (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Sweeet (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Wheeeee (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: I think game performance has improved since I upgraded the server hardware as well (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Nice! (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Oh. My map is a triangle again..  (ooc)&D
&CVarchild: vision spells = more map viewable (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Okay.  (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Okay.  (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Really not a big fan of death rooms. (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Took me ten minutes to kill myself so I could get out. Not cool, Dudes.  (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Ouch. (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Yeah..  (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Didn't know that was a thing. (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: So you're trapped and the only way you can get out is to kill yourself? (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Yeah. There's a pit to the east. Can't cast spells, communicate, or climb out.  (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Oh man. That's terrible. (ooc)&D
&CLinnia: I thought they were removing the death rooms (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Oh I don't know. /shrugs (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Huh. Groups get 3x the exp? I need to catch up and join you, Isahn. Lol. (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Oh yeah. For sure.  (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Oh yeah. For sure.  (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: There are all kinds of bonuses. More people online. The double stuff. Super mystery puzzle solver triple.  (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: That's true. I've been saving up on the puzzle. (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: How long does it take for the 3x Exp to kick in? Do I need to wait for new mobs to respawn?  (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Or go to new areas?  (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: No clue on my end. I assumed it was instant, but I haven't tried it. (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Yeah no change so far. Sometimes I find that I "run out" of exp on mobs and have to go elsewhere for a little bit. Then I can come back and its fine again.  (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Weird. (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Yeah I'm not getting the 3x Exp for some reason.  (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Oh wow. Maybe bug it? Don't know how things are normally reported here. (ooc)&D
&CVladero: Congrats to both of you. (ooc)&D
&CVladero: grats Isahn (ooc)&D
&CIsahn: Thanks, Boss. (ooc)&D
&CVladero: grats Tasivil (ooc)&D
&CVladero: grats Ibrahim (ooc)&D
&CIbrahim: Thank you (ooc)&D
&WIsahn tells: Varchild can you stop kicking me out! Jeez!&D
